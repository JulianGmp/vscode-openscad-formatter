# OpenSCAD Formatter

[![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/JulianGmp.openscad-formatter.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JulianGmp.openscad-formatter)

[Also available at Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/JulianGmp/openscad-formatter)

A simple formatter for OpenSCAD files, that utilizes clang-format.

*Important: you will have to install clang-format yourself, it is not shipped with this extension.*

*Note: this extension does not provide syntax highlighting or other language features for OpenSCAD files directly, instead it pulls [Antyos.openscad](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Antyos.openscad) as a dependency.*

## Extension Settings

* `openscad-formatter.clang-format.executable`: The path to the clang-format executable.
* `openscad-formatter.clang-format.style`: The style parameters for clang-format*

*please refer to the [documentation of clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) for the various options.

## Known issues

- Partial formatting („Format Selection“ in the command palette) is not implemented.
- vscode's format settings for tab size or space replacement are currenlty ignored.
